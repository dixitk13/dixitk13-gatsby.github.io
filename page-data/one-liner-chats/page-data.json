There, I said it! üôà</h1>\n<p>Most of people in this world might have used one or another form of chat/messaging\nlike iMessage, Jabber, Slack, Teams, etc. Today, at most workplaces messaging is an essential part of communication for most people working w/ each other.</p>\n<p>Software engineers all have a habit of writing code and\nusing the most popular version control to manage their code called GIT.</p>\n<p>Can you follow that with your chats? - Absolutely!</p>\n<p>Here's what I do, or rather how my pings look like:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">[10:15 AM] Dixit: Hi John, about that PR, did you get a\nchance to look at it?

Seems to me like its breaking on\nChrome 83 due to downloads being blocked in iframe,\nbefore customers report. Should be a small fix.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now one would ask, what does this benefit me with?</p>\n<p>Well, I'll say why maintain commit history with 52th word mark and wrap the rest of the commit message at 72th word mark?</p>\n<h1>üìú HISTORY üìú</h1>\n<p>Its's a powerful thing. Commit history is a very important thing!\nIt helps understand the how the code has been developing and what churn has\nbeen happening in the codebase, etc etc.</p>\n<p>To me scenario 1 looks like a commit history which is shown below:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">* 5d53d5a - complete\n* 3b97cf3 - wip\n* 8c2e4b8 - pull from master\n* 4407227 - boss called wip\n* 70cdc42 - typo\n* 329f368 - fix padding/margin\n* 18007ad - #ABC321 in progress</code></pre></div>\n<p>Where as the scenario 2 looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">* 6e53924 - Fix TKT-333 bug found via review w/ @jparker\n* 844b34c - Fix TKT-331 chrome 83 iframe download\n* 57152ff - Feat TKT-322 allowing i18n for only the menus</code></pre></div>\n<p>Which one do you like more? Retrospection is the key, scroll two pages up and\nyou'll have conversations which kinda helps remember the status of things.</p>\n<p>Use threads.\nThreads will let you condense/group those conversations into singular items.</p>\n<p>Together we can make \"chat-history-great\"!üçª</p>"}},"pageContext":{}}}
