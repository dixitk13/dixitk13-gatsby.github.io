I was an Application Developer for a J2EE application which dealt with “VPN automation” automating the entire VPN order processing till the step of provisioning.

There's a lot one does in 3 years, so I'll mention a few highlights:

- Designed and developed a lot of web-services to integrate in the application.

- Reduced redundancy in code and number of database connections by implementing a Generic Database Service in Hibernate using JAX-WS framework & Java Reflections.

- Spearheaded the migration of Web Services & Web Applications from Tomcat 6.0 to Weblogic 12c.
