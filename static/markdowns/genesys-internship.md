As an intern I was tasked with improving the operations and debugging experience with the core application of Genesys(soundbite) at the center of the task.

- I designed a scalable data architecture using open-source software to send logs generated via the application to a centralized logging system. The architecture comprised of Log-courier, Logstash, Elasticsearch & Kibana (ELK) with searchers, masters, data-nodes & indexers. The architecture was capable of ingesting 11,000 events per second.

- Also customized Logstash filters in Ruby (JRuby), Perl scripts & Java indexing modules to ingest synthesized data.
