- I am currently working on a Web Application based on Flask, MongoDB, MySQL, React & Redux.
- I have implemented a generic notification system which notifies based on the latest record, insufficient
  state, threshold levels, etc.
- Also designed an Admin System to grant access control for the entire organization.
- Integrated cflow into test-automation code base system to achieve code-coverage.
