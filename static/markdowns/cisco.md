I am currently working on a Web Application based on Flask, MongoDB, MySQL, React & Redux.

- We use blueprintJS for UI Components and follow Airbnb standards for ECMAScript 6
- I have unilaterally implemented a generic notification system which notifies based on the latest record, insufficient
  state, threshold levels, etc.
- Also designed an Admin System to grant access control for the entire organization.
- Integrated cflow into automation code base system to achieve code-coverage.
