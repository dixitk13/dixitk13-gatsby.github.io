I worked on a Web Application based on Flask, MongoDB, MySQL,
React & Redux.

- We use blueprintJS for UI Components and follow Airbnb standards for ECMAScript 6
- I have unilaterally implemented a custom notification system, using SNS/SQS
  and AWS Lambda, which notifies based on the latest record, insufficient state,
  threshold levels, etc.
- Spearheaded the team to achieve CATO(Cloud Allowed to Operate),
  a security process by Cisco, for operating in an external cloud.
- Designed an Admin System to grant access control for the entire organization.
- Integrated cflow into automation code base system to achieve code-coverage.
