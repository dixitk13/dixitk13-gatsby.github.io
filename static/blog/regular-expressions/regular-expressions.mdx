Everyone has used regular expressions sometime of life to check validation 
of strings or you know capture a particular group of text you might be 
looking for. 

Today I'll go over some basics, just for refreshers, incase folks are new 
to regular expressions and some advanced stuff which I personally found useful.

Skip directly to [Advanced Section](#Advanced-Stuff) ‚û°Ô∏è


## Basics 

A regular expression consists of a pattern and a set of flags. 
You could do it in following ways:
- Use the contructor pattern 
  e.g.: `new RegExp("pattern")` or `new RegExp("pattern", "i")`
- Use the short hand by providing your pattern between `/`. 
  In this specific scenario javascript considers any text between 
  `/` as regular expressions but has some shortcomings which we'll discuss later on.
  e.g.: `/pattern/` or `/MYPATTER/i`

### Flags
Regular expressions have a few flags which are useful for creating powerful expressions viz.

| Flags    | Description  | 
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `i`      | Ignore case, says it all |
| `g`      | Global search across the entire string(not just first occurrence) and return all occurrences |
| `m`      | Multiline mode  |
| `y`      | Sticky positions match |

There's more flags TBH, but the above are the most common ones I've come across.

#### Flag examples using match 
Starting with simpler examples. For the below examples, we'll have a constant
paragraph like below and we'll match against regex.

```javascript
const paragraph = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';
<insert regex from below> 
const found = paragraph.match(regex);
console.log(found);
```

Lets search for the word, "the" and we'll do like so: 

```javascript
const regex = /the/;

> ["the"]

console.log(found.index);
> 31
```
Oh nice, I can find the index for the match as well, huh! 

ü§î Oh but wait, how can I ignore case and match the first "The"?

```javascript
const regex = /the/i;

> ["The"]
```
Looks like the above matched only the first "the" by ignoring case. 

üò∂ Nah, that's not what I was looking for. 
What happens if I do a global search using a `g` flag?

```javascript
const regex = /the/g;

> ["the"]
```
Looks like it globally searched for the second the? 

üòí What happens if I do both `i` and `g` together?

```javascript
const regex = /the/ig;

> ["The", "the"]
```
ü§® I see that's what it is? Ignore case and global search together huh.


### Functions 
There's three functions in string operations where regexes are super helpful viz.
- `match(/str1/)`: Finds a "match" for a string pattern.
- `replace(/str1/, "str2")`: Finds a match and replace it with another string as the 2nd argument. 
- `test(/str1/)`: returns true/false for checking against a string pattern match.

These will be the most common used functions.

Regular expressions also have a _Shorthand_ character classes, _Anchors_ 
and _Quantifiers_ which all help in simplifying the targetted expressions.

We'll see _Quantifiers_, _Anchors_ and _Shorthand_ character examples together.

### Quantifiers  
A quantifier quantifies, like how many times does a particular "expression" occur.

| Quantifier  | Description  | 
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `+`         | Plus indicates one-or-more  |
| `*`         | Star says zero-or-more, basically optional as well - the greedy boy! | 
| `?`         | Question mark indicates, one-or-zero matches |
| \|         |  A logical OR ofcourse  | 

### Anchors
Regular expressions also have anchor elements viz. 

| Anchors  | Description  | 
|----------|--------------|
| `^`      | starts with  |
| `$`      | ends with |

### Shorthand Character classes
Character classes are usually captured by surrounding them with square braces. 

If you specify `^` inside the capture braces `[^xyz]` they'd stand for negation. Yes, negation! 
So lets look at the character classes now:

Words and digits: 

| Pattern  | Description  | 
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `[A-Z]`  | captures any captial alphabet between A to Z.     | 
| `[a-z]`  | captures any small letter alphabet between a to z  |
| `[0-9]`  | any digit between 0 to 9. Short hand is `[\d]` |
| `[\w]`   | captures any word, in totality it stands for `[a-zA-Z0-9]` |
| `[\W]`   | captures anything that's not a word, in totality it stands for `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` |
| `[\D]`   | Short hand for not a digit. |

White-space stuff:

| Pattern | Description  | 
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `[\s]`  | captures any whitespace character.  |
| `[\S]`  | captures any non-whitespace character. |
|  `.`    | any character of-course | 

Negation stuff: 

| Pattern    | Description  | 
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `[^abc]`   | would stand for not a, b, or c |
| `[^apple]` | would stand for not the word apple but everything apart from that word. |

#### Examples 

Let's start with words and digits: 

Here's lets say you just wanna match against finding the new bootstrap version?
Or maybe you changed your mind are are looking for versions of frameworks 
i.e. words followed by numbers. Below are some examples illustrating the same: 
```javascript
const str0 = "New Bootstrap5 is out. Older Boostrap4 isn't any good";
console.log(str0.match(/(Bootstrap\d)/)); // "Bootstrap5"
console.log(str0.match(/(\w+\d)/)); // "Bootstrap5"
console.log(str0.match(/(\w+\d)/g)); // ["Bootstrap5", "Bootstrap4"]
```

Here goes the clique US telphone number regex: 
```javascript
const str0 = 
"This is my nicely formatter number +1(123)-456-7890." +
"Also this can be it w/o the extension 123-456-7890."+
"Rightly, I can put braces & hypens wherever (123) 456-7890" +
"Oh yeah, lets not forget w/o hypens: 123 456 7890" + 
"Or the way with periods in between like:123.456.7890" + 
"Gotta match'em all!";

str0.match(/((\+\d{1,2})?(\(?\d{3}\)?.?\d{3}.?\d{4}))/g);
// ["+1(123)-456-7890", "123-456-7890", "(123) 456-7890", "123 456 7890", "123.456.7890"]
```

Let's break it down one by one. 
- `(\+\d{1,2})?`: Indicates the symbols `(` & `+` followed by a digit quantifying as occuring max twice.
And the entire thing is optional since its followed by a `?` indicating 0,1 occurrences. 
- `\(?\d{3}\)?`: Indicates the first and last round braces as being optional by using `\(?`.
The first `\` is the escape character used to implicitly say look for a round brace `(`. 
The `\d{3}` ofcourse says look for 3 digits.
- `.?`: Here we're looking for an optional delimiter, like a space or `-` or `.`.
- `\d{3}`: Looking for the second set of 3 digits 
- `.?`: Another optional delimiter
- `\d{4}`: The last set of 4 digits to be captured. 

The entire expression is surrounded by round braces to allow capturing the expression. 

And Voila! We have a regex capturing a phone-number, but its not free of bugs I'd assume. 


Let's try anchors. In the below example, raining ends with would match in L02 but 
in L03 it won't match rain as ending. We know ofcourse why. 


```javascript
const str1 = "it was raining";
console.log(/raining$/.test(str1)); // true
console.log(/rain$/.test(str1)); // false

console.log(/^it/.test(str1)); // true
console.log(/^was/.test(str1)); // false
```

Hope those examples made sense.

## Advanced Stuff
Lets start with Word Boundary and then go towards specific examples which I recently have written.

### Word Boundary 
- `[\b]`: the `b` here stands for word-boundary. 
Which matches three things viz. A start of the sentence, end of sentence - since they "boundaries". 
And it matches end/start of a word - meaning:
1. "a place where the word can begin like with space" 
2. "a place where the word ends, like exclamation or another space"
Let's see with examples shall we. 

```javascript
console.log("GO! Bananas, Monkey?".match(/\bMonkey\b/)); // Monkey 
console.log("GO! Bananas, Monkey?".match(/\bMonke\b/)); // null 
console.log("GO! Bananas, Monkey?".match(/\bGO\b/)); // Go 
console.log("GO! Bananas, Monkey?".match(/\bBanana\b/)); // null 
```

As you see in:
- example 1: `Monkey` is matched, since its ending as "word boundary"
- example 3: `GO` is matched, since its starting as "word boundary"
- example 2/4: `Monke` & `Banana` both are NOT matched, since its not ending/starting with a boundary

Let's take another example. Try capturing time from the below items, where time is a xx:yy two digit numbers:

```javascript
const timestr1 = "I drink coffee at 09:00 AM and try to finish by 11:00 AM." +
"Sometimes I even do an afternoon tea around 16:00."+ 
"But tea at18:00isn't tea, is it? Nor is 123:456PM" // ??
```

So, looks like we are capturing two digits numbers which can be
captured by `\d` and quantifying them as `{2}` occurrences like `\d{2}`. 
And seperate them with a `:`. Cool. How about avoid the 18:00 ü§î

The word boundary üòÆ that will do it! Putting it all together, it looks like so:

```javascript
timestr1.match(/\b\d{2}:\d{2}\b/g)); 
// => ["09:00", "11:00", "16:00"]
```

Wow üòÆ Or not yet?


### The `new RegExp`
In basics, we talked about how there's yet another syntax for creating a regex. 

This new method comes with its own pros and cons, lets do cons first: 
We need to escape _Escape Characters_ like `\ ^ * ( ) .` and more such stuff.

But this new expression, also allows variable substitution. 
We'll first see how to escape characters and then try variable substitution.

If we want to re-write the time-regex, it'll need to escapse those `\` characters:

```javascript
const r = new RegExp("\\b\\d{2}:\\d{2}\\b", "g");
console.log(timestr1.match(r));
// => ["09:00", "11:00", "16:00"]
```
Not pretty I know! The second argument for the RegExp constructor is the flags we allow in. 
In the above example, its the globals flag to find all the time hours. 

Let's say we wanted to capture post fix for a set of distributed system 
names. Really contrived example below, but stay with me. 

We have lots of different systems. Each system has a unique ID
which suffixed by a UUID, which is either a number/UUID.

e.g.: `variable_1`, `distributedVariable_uu1_22d_334_d`, etc.

Let's try and extract that UUID: 
We know we're looking for a system name followed by the ID, let's make a postfix catcher?

```typescript
const t1: string = "controller_1";
const t2: string = "controller_uu1-4dd-3ee-41";
const t3: string = "controller_8";
const t4: string = "shard_1";
const t5: string = "shard_uu1-4dd-3ee-41";
const t6: string = "shard";
const t7: string = "shard_";

const getUUID = (s: string, prefix: string): string => {
  const match = s.match(new RegExp(`${prefix}_([a-zA-Z0-9\-]+)$`));
  return match && match[1];
}

console.log(getUUID(t1, "controller")); // => 1
console.log(getUUID(t2, "controller")); // => uu1-4dd-3ee-41
console.log(getUUID(t4, "shard")); // 1
console.log(getUUID(t5, "shard")); //=> uu1-4dd-3ee-41
console.log(getUUID(t6, "shard")); //=> null
console.log(getUUID(t7, "shard")); //=> null
```

Found it useful? Still got more examples, hang tight! 

Let's say you got to parse filtering expression in log-query languages. 
What's that you'd ask? Well a super high level w/o going into the depths could be: 

> Every log-query languages being offered in logging solutions across the cloud providers have a way to expression their query and a filtering expression.

Let's see with an example. Here we are searching "logs" and would like to capture the filter expressions into variables of 

| Name         | Description  | 
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `FIELD_NAME` | field name or the column/key of the log |
| `OP`         | operator viz. `=`, `=>`, `<=`, `>`, etc | 
| `VALUE`      | the value of the operator |

Example 1: 
```bash
search logs 
WHERE resource.type = "my-instance" 
AND type = ERROR 
```

Example 2:
```bash
search logs2
WHERE resource.type != "API"
AND api.response.code = 400
```

This is what we'll be extracting out of the two examples. 
I've called `1.1` and `1.2` for second value of expression filters. 

| Name         |   Example 1.1   |Example 1.2| Example 2.1 | Example 2.2 |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `FIELD_NAME` | `resource.type` | `type`    | `resource.type`|  `api.response.code`|
| `OP`         | `=`             |  `=`      | `!=` | `!=` |
| `VALUE`      | `"my-instance"` | `"ERROR"` | `API`| `400` |

How do we go about this. Let's start with operators since we know they'll be constants. 
```javascript
const OPERATORS = "=|>=|<=|!=|>|<";
```

Next what do we allow for values? Everything? Lets use the greedy capturing mechanism?
Something like `.*` should work fine, looks, like quotes are optional. 

Surely we'll factor that in.

How about anything except whitespace? like `[^\\s]+`

How can we capture the fieldName? Looks like it can constain periods or other special stuff - lets try 
`[a-zA-Z\.\_]+`? ü§î How does it matter what the fieldName is? 

Can I just say anything except operators? like `[^${OPERATORS}]`

So our final regex should capture specific groups like __fieldName__, __op__ & __value__ .
To capture those we'll use the round braces `()`. 

And it looks like so: 

```javascript
new RegExp(`([^${OPERATORS}]+)(${OPERATORS})([^\\s]+)`)
```

- `([^${OPERATORS}]+)`: captures anything except operators
- `([${OPERATORS}])`: captures a single operator
- `([^\\s]+)`: captures everything except whitespace.

Boom! üí•

For the sake of the example, we'll consider nothing comes after the filters 
and **WHERE** is the keyword specifying the start of it.

Let's put all that together and try it:

```javascript
const q1: string = `search logs2 WHERE resource.type != "API" AND api.response.code = 400`;
const q2: string = `search logs WHERE resource.type = "my-instance" AND type = ERROR `;
const q3: string = `search logs WHERE resource__type = "my-instance" AND type = ERROR `;

const WHERE: string = "WHERE";
const AND: string = "AND";
const OPERATORS = "=|>=|<=|!=|>|<";

interface Filter {
  fieldName: string;
  op: string;
  value: string;
}

const regex = new RegExp(`([^${OPERATORS}]+)(${OPERATORS})([^\\s]+)`)
const parseFilter = (q: string): Filter[] => {
  const filters = q.split(WHERE);
  if (!filters || filters.length < 2) return [];

  const filterStr = filters[1];

  return filterStr.split(AND).reduce((prev, curr) => {
    const strippedCurrent = curr.replace(/ /g, "");
    const [match, fieldName, op, value] = strippedCurrent.match(regex)
    if (!match) return prev;

    const filter: Filter = {
      fieldName, op, value
    };

    return [...prev, filter];
  }, []);
}

console.log(parseFilter(q1)); 
/**
 * => [ 
 *  { fieldName: 'resource.type', op: '!=', value: '"API"' },‚Äà
 *  { fieldName: 'api.response.code', op: '=', value: '400' } 
 * ]‚Äà
 *  */ 
console.log(parseFilter(q2)); 
/**
 * [ 
 *  { fieldName: 'resource.type', op: '=', value: '"my-instance"' },‚Äà
 *  { fieldName: 'type', op: '=', value: 'ERROR' } 
 * ]‚Äà
 */
console.log(parseFilter(q3)); // => 
/**
 * [ 
 *  { fieldName: 'resource__type', op: '=', value: '"my-instance"' },
 *  { fieldName: 'type', op: '=', value: 'ERROR' } 
 * ]‚Äà
 */
```

I might add more advanced specific examples as I come across, but hopefully you found that useful. 


## Future Stuff
I did a lot of multiline regex when I was an intern to play with logstash 
and capturing the right amount of data from logs, but honestly I don't remember 
those examples, except them being really cool üòé

Also, I haven't played much with substitution and look-around regex stuff,
but if I do - I'll update this post :) 

Until next time ‚òÆÔ∏è
